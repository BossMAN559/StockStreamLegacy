Twitch Invests In The Stock Market - Online MultiPlayer Game Launches - Press Release

Hello [Site] Staff,

This Tuesday at 9:00 AM EST we'll be launching our new co-operative multiplayer Stock Market game on twitch.tv.

We've read and enjoyed your previous articles published about Twitch Plays Pokemon and Twitch Installs Archlinux,
and thought your readers might enjoy reading about ours.

We're spreading the word and have started the countdown to launch at https://twitchinvests.com/

We hope you get a chance to check it out, please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or want to know more!

[P.S. We think you'll be glad to hear that headlines from [Site] are featured in the stream!]

Thanks,
Twitch Invests Team
